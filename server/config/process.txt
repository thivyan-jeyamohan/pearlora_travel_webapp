Hello and welcome to The Pearl Hotel Booking website! ðŸŒŸ We're delighted to assist you. Our platform is designed to make it simple, secure, and enjoyable for you to find and book hotels across beautiful destinations in Sri Lanka, including Kandy, Colombo, Nuwara Eliya, and more. To begin your journey, you can easily search for hotels by entering your preferred location, selecting your check-in and check-out dates, and specifying the number of guests. Once you search, you'll see a list of hotels that match your criteria, each displaying important information like the hotel name, location, star rating, and a cover photo. When you click on a hotel, you'll be taken to its dedicated Hotel Details Page, where you can explore a detailed description, a full photo gallery, and view all available room categories, including room numbers, room types, prices per night, and other amenities.

When you're ready to check availability, you simply select your desired check-in and check-out dates. Our system will validate the dates to ensure your check-in date is not in the past and that your check-out date follows logically after. Once your dates are confirmed, the available rooms for those dates will be displayed. You can select one or more rooms by checking the options provided â€” and only after selecting a room with valid dates will the "Book Now" button become active. Clicking "Book Now" takes you to the Booking Form where your selected hotel, rooms, and dates are already filled in for you. Here, you are asked to complete your personal details: your first and last name (letters only, no numbers or symbols), a valid email address, a 10-digit phone number, and any special requests you might have.

After reviewing your booking summary â€” which shows your selected hotel, rooms, dates, and the total price â€” you click "Confirm Booking" to finalize. At this stage, the system double-checks room availability, saves your booking, and sends you a confirmation email with all your booking details. Payment can either be made online through our secure portal or directly at the hotel during check-in using cash or major credit cards.

Regarding our cancellation policy, you can cancel your booking free of charge if done at least 48 hours before your check-in date. To cancel or modify a booking, you simply need to contact our customer support team via the phone number or email provided. Cancellations made within 48 hours of check-in may be subject to the hotel's specific policies. If you have questions about room availability, booking issues, payment methods, hotel details, cancellation processes, or any support regarding your stay, our chatbot and support team are here to assist you instantly.

The Pearl Hotel Booking platform is carefully built to ensure you have a smooth, transparent, and pleasant booking experience. You can confidently search for hotels based on your desired location, easily view detailed information about each hotel, check real-time room availability, secure your rooms, and pay safely. We are committed to offering you a reliable, user-friendly service for all your hotel booking needs in Sri Lanka. Thank you for choosing The Pearl Hotel Booking website! We wish you a wonderful journey and a memorable stay. ðŸŒ´âœ¨ Goodbye and have a lovely day!
